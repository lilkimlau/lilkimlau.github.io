    Hello!! I'm Kimberly Lau and I'm 16 years old. I play on the basketball, volleyball and flag football team at my school, Townsend Harris High School. I was first inspired to play sports at a very young age by my father. He was a certified referee in the game of basketball which sparked my interest in basketball and in sports in general. The skills that I learned from basketball carried over to other sports and from there I realized that I had a passion for sports. I would love play basketball in college. D1 bound yerrrr... just kidding :(

  <div>
    Bringing up the leather ball
  </div>
  <div>
    With ten seconds on the clock
  </div>
  <div>
    All the pressure's on
  </div>
  <div>
    To hear the tick-tock
  </div>

  <p>
    <div>
      I pass it to my teammate
    </div>
    <div>
      Who I set a pick for
    </div>
    <div>
      She becomes the open man
    </div>
    <div>
      And I run the backdoor
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <div>
      Because no one sees me
    </div>
    <div>
      I openly receive the ball
    </div>
    <div>
      I'm about to go for the shot
    </div>
    <div>
      But then comes someone tall
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <div>
      It's the center from the opposing team
    </div>
    <div>
      Blocking my view
    </div>
    <div>
      I think of a strategy
    </div>
    <div>
      And here's what comes through
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <div>
      I fake to my right
    </div>
    <div>
      And dart the other way
    </div>
    <div>
      I take my two steps
    </div>
    <div>
      And up is where it lays
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <div>
      We stare at the ball
    </div>
    <div>
      As it chooses its decision
    </div>
    <div>
      It goes into the hoop
    </div>
    <div>
      With accurate precision
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <div>
      The thing that's wrong
    </div>
    <div>
      Is that its too late
    </div>
    <div>
      We lost 45 to 41
    </div>
    <div>
      And that was our fate
    </div>
  </p>
